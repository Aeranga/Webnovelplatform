            <h1>Chapter 1 | I Am The Director</h1>
            <p>Li Yuan was awakened by the ringing of the phone.</p>
        
            <p>Li Yuan was awakened by the ringing of the phone.

                "Ding-ling-ling~"
                
                "Huh?" The person sleeping with half of his body lying on the table moved, slowly raised his head, and made a dissatisfied sound.
                
                Li Yuan rubbed his eyes and scratched his itchy head. There were clear marks on his right face from sleeping with his arm as a pillow.
                
                "Ding-ling-ling~" The ringing was still ringing, and the microphone was not picked up, which made it look urgent.
                
                "f**k!" Li Yuan blinked, his face blank, "Where is this? Am I not playing games at home..."
                
                He turned his head hurriedly, and his eyes were reflected in a strange environment.
                
                This is a single-person office. In front of him is a desk with a computer and documents on it. Behind him is a painting of "Serve the People". The whole office is filled with a positive energy.
                
                "Ding-ling-ling~" The ringing of the phone kept hitting Li Yuan's head. He came back to his senses and raised his hand and picked up the receiver involuntarily under the urging of the ringing.
                
                [Hello, Director...]
                
                A voice with a hint of respect came from the receiver. Suddenly, Li Yuan's mind flashed, and all kinds of information exploded in his mind like fireworks.
                
                Li Yuan was stunned for a long time, and then subconsciously uttered two words: "f**k!"
                
                Li Yuan traveled through time and came to a world that was not the original world, and became the director of a police station in a small county called "Zhai County" in Xia Country.
                
                Coincidentally, the original body had the same name and surname as Li Yuan.
                
                [... Director, what did you say? It's like this. The family of the abuser who was detained for domestic violence the day before yesterday came and asked for the release of the abuser. Xiao Zhou refused, and the family was making a fuss...]
                
                The helpless voice of the subordinate came from the receiver, pulling Li Yuan's thoughts back to reality.
                
                He came back to his senses and looked down at the documents on the table. This is the latest report.
                
                I remember that the day before yesterday, a woman called the police and said she was being abused by her family. The police station went out to arrest the domestic abuser and detained him. After being detained for a day and a night, the family came to ask for him.
                
                Xiao Zhou, um, Li Yuan remembered that he was a young man who had just joined the company, named Zhou Wenjia, who was very energetic and full of justice.
                
                Alas~
                
                Li Yuan sighed silently, this kind of thing is the most difficult to deal with.
                
                "The family members are here, who are they?"
                
                Li Yuan said while flipping through the files to check the personal information of the domestic violence incident.
                
                At 9:13 pm the day before yesterday, a woman named Wang Xiaomei called the police and cried that she was beaten by her husband Chen Zhihe.
                
                The police station immediately sent police, who had many scars on their bodies.
                
                Before the police entered the house, they heard Wang's heartbreaking cry.
                
                When they entered the house, they saw that the woman was being beaten on the ground by her husband.
                
                She couldn't move, her nose and face were swollen, and she looked pitiful.
                
                The police held Chen Zhihe down, gave him a verbal education, asked his wife to go to the hospital for a check-up, and then took the abuser away.
                
                The answer on the other end of the phone was, [... my wife and mother-in-law are here...]
                
                Li Yuan listened and looked at the information. This family has a mother, son, daughter-in-law, and a six-year-old daughter, a total of four people.
                
                Oh, what a hassle!
                
                Li Yuan scratched his head, looking annoyed. Just by looking at this family situation, he knew how difficult it was to deal with.
                
                The wife had always been dissatisfied with her husband and mother-in-law because she only gave birth to a daughter. The husband was the only man in the family and the pillar of the family.
                
                Chen Zhihe's old mother was also present at the time.
                
                She couldn't pull her son away.
                
                She also strongly supported calling the police to arrest her son.
                
                After a day and a night, she came to ask for his release again.
                
                She just wanted the police to teach her son a lesson, but she couldn't bear to let her son suffer.
                
                "What did Xiao Zhou say?" Li Yuan closed the folder and fished on the table, looking for a teacup.
                
                [Director, Xiao Zhou doesn't want to release him. He said that this would only encourage and condone domestic violence and would not solve the problem. Moreover, we will release him as soon as the family members make a fuss. Our dignity...]
                
                Li Yuan poured the cold tea in one hand and nodded in agreement. He was right.
                
                [But the family members made a fuss. The wife said she was no longer angry and asked us to release him. The old lady was crying and shouting at the door, saying that we were arresting people at random and murdering her son. It was unreasonable...]
                
                The voice of the person on the other end of the phone did not hide his disgust and anger.
                
                Li Yuan took a sip of tea, put the cup on the table with a "bang", and said angrily: "Ha! What a shrew, I hate this kind of family the most.
                
                At the beginning, she was beaten badly and cried to call the police to arrest people.
                
                Now she has changed her mind after being locked up for a night.
                
                If they want to arrest people, they ask us to arrest them.
                
                If they want people, they ask us to release them.
                
                Do they think we are their nanny? This is not a vegetable market.
                
                We will not release them.
                
                We will definitely not release them.
                
                Tell the family members that if they make trouble again, they will be arrested for obstructing public service!"
                
                Li Yuan was so angry that he cursed.
                
                Every time he saw such domestic violence incidents, the perpetrators were only verbally educated, and the family members changed their faces faster than turning a book to forgive, forcing the police to release people.
                
                The drama made him sick, and he would not indulge them.
                
                The other end of the phone was silent for a few seconds, and then confirmed and asked, [Director, if you don't release people, if the family members continue to make trouble, you will arrest the family members, right? ï¼½
                
                "Yes." Li Yuan was full of vigor and emotion, "Even if the emperor comes, I will detain them and see how they make trouble."
                
                [But, it may be difficult to deal with this...]
                
                "Why is it difficult to deal with it? We are not arresting people randomly. Please record the surveillance video for me. I will tell the director and others." Li Yuan ordered again.
                
                [Do you really want to do this, director...] The subordinate was still hesitant and surprised, surprised by the director's decision.
                
                As the lowest-level civil servant who receives the masses, he knows the trouble of such family affairs best. In the end, I am afraid that the government will have to release them.
                
                Li Yuan slapped the table and said, "No, arrest the troublemakers. I am the director and I will take responsibility!"</p>
