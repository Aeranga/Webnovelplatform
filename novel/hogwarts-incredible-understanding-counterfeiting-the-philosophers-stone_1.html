            <h2>Hope Life Can Always Be Boring</h2>
            <p>
                July 17, 1991.

                England.
                
                Devon.
                
                Rochester Castle.
                
                The early morning sunlight shines into the bedroom, waking up those who are lying in bed.
                
                Du Wei rubbed his eyes and climbed up reluctantly.
                
                The slightly cool washing magic made him wake up instantly.
                
                Then the wardrobe opens automatically.
                
                Wherever he looked, the clothes he wanted floated over and replaced his pajamas.
                
                After a big yawn, Du Wei went downstairs and entered the restaurant.
                
                "Happy birthday, Master Du Wei!"
                
                The fat lady in the portrait greeted him.
                
                Then he started talking endlessly:
                
                "It's half-past nine in the morning. You got up so late that Mrs. Perenal decided not to leave you breakfast."
                
                "She and Monsieur Flamel have gone for a walk on the seaside."
                
                "Today's homework is to prepare the potion of immortality. The magic stone is on the table..."
                
                "Shut up!"
                
                "Let's talk after I finish eating!"
                
                The fat lady was about to say something more, but Du Wei gave her a hard look and told her to shut her mouth obediently.
                
                Homework is the most annoying thing!
                
                They have all traveled to a magical world and still have to do homework!
                
                Even if it’s the little wizard’s most important eleventh birthday!
                
                Still have to do homework!
                
                Du Wei picked up the red stone on the table.
                
                The Sorcerer's Stone, which drives countless wizards in the magic world crazy, is like a toy in Du Wei's hands.
                
                Throw...
                
                Catch it!
                
                Toss again!            </p>
