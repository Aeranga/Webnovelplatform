            <h2>Hope Life Can Always Be Boring</h2>
            <p>
                July 17, 1991.

                England.
                
                Devon.
                
                Rochester Castle.
                
                The early morning sunlight shines into the bedroom, waking up those who are lying in bed.
                
                Du Wei rubbed his eyes and climbed up reluctantly.
                
                The slightly cool washing magic made him wake up instantly.
                
                Then the wardrobe opens automatically.
                
                Wherever he looked, the clothes he wanted floated over and replaced his pajamas.
                
                After a big yawn, Du Wei went downstairs and entered the restaurant.
                
                "Happy birthday, Master Du Wei!"
                
                The fat lady in the portrait greeted him.
                
                Then he started talking endlessly:
                
                "It's half-past nine in the morning. You got up so late that Mrs. Perenal decided not to leave you breakfast."
                
                "She and Monsieur Flamel have gone for a walk on the seaside."
                
                "Today's homework is to prepare the potion of immortality. The magic stone is on the table..."
                
                "Shut up!"
                
                "Let's talk after I finish eating!"
                
                The fat lady was about to say something more, but Du Wei gave her a hard look and told her to shut her mouth obediently.
                
                Homework is the most annoying thing!
                
                They have all traveled to a magical world and still have to do homework!
                
                Even if it’s the little wizard’s most important eleventh birthday!
                
                Still have to do homework!
                
                Du Wei picked up the red stone on the table.
                
                The Sorcerer's Stone, which drives countless wizards in the magic world crazy, is like a toy in Du Wei's hands.
                
                Throw...
                
                Catch it!
                
                Toss again!            </p>
            <p>
                Du Wei played with the magic stone nonchalantly and walked into the kitchen.

                There was a clanking sound immediately inside.
                
                All the pots and pans stood up immediately and lined up, saying hello in unison:
                
                "Good morning, Master Du Wei!"
                
                "Good morning!"
                
                Du Wei nodded with satisfaction:
                
                "As expected of me, I trained the cooking class with my own hands!"
                
                "Very good, very energetic!"
                
                "One serving of tomato and egg noodles, let's take a rest if it's not relevant!"
                
                The order is issued.
                
                The kitchen suddenly became lively.
                
                A stove burns with a blue flame.
                
                The wok turned over and jumped on it, moaning in pleasure as it was being burned.
                
                The yellow copper kettle on the side shouted:
                
                "Here comes the water!"
                
                The clear spring water automatically filled its round body.
                
                Then it used the short handle to grab some flames from the next door and lit another stove under it.
                
                At this time, the wok was already burning and smoking.
                
                Rotate the oil bottle around the wok twice and pour peanut oil into the wok.
                
                After the oil is hot.
                
                The spatula drives several eggs to line up and jump to the top of the hot pot.
                
                Then it pretended to shout:
                
                "Split into pieces!"
                
                Then jump up and break the eggs one by one and slap the empty eggshells into the trash can.
                
                The eggs are fried in hot oil, making a sizzling sound, and the aroma soon spreads.
                
                Tomatoes, lettuce, green onions, and ham are rolled onto the cutting board one by one.
                
                A long and sharp kitchen knife rotated and jumped, cutting them into the required shape one by one.
                
                The kitchen utensils all perform their duties.
                
                Busy and orderly.
                
                Only a coffeepot stared longingly.
                
                It's like watching a stage play.
                
                It's that irrelevant.            </p>
            <p>
                "Master Du Wei, let's have a cup of coffee. Drinking coffee in the morning will make you feel better!"

                Du Wei took a look at the flattering coffee pot:
                
                "I don't like coffee."
                
                "I have newly learned the art of latte art, and I can create a perfect moon flower pattern..."
                
                "Don't waste your efforts. I know you want the Philosopher's Stone."
                
                "Please, Master Du Wei, don't you think a golden coffee pot is very handsome?"
                
                "But I prefer the golden soy milk machine, thank you!"
                
                "Oh no! Soy milk is a heresy and should not appear in the house of the noble Nicolémet!"
                
                Afraid of being turned into a soymilk machine, the coffee maker stepped back and stopped talking.
                
                Not long after, a portion of tomato and egg noodles with delicious flavor and color was brought to the table.
                
                "Reward, reward!"
                
                There was a clamor among the cooks who had finished their work.
                
                Du Wei reluctantly took out the magic stone and tapped their bodies one by one.
                
                This is the reward they want.
                
                Under the influence of the magic stone, all the kitchen utensils that were touched turned into brilliant gold.
                
                This is the most desired glory for all magic items in Rochester Castle.
                
                Magic stone.
                
                Midas touch.
                
                Immortality.
                
                This is the unanimous perception of the outside world about the Nicoléme couple.
                
                But only Du Wei knows the truth.
                
                A magician can indeed turn stone into gold.
                
                But it can only convert metals into substances very similar to gold.
                
                Softer than gold and more beautiful in color.
                
                Most people can't recognize it.            </p>
            <p>
                Before Muggle technology had developed, Nicolas Flamel could still use it to defraud people of ill-gotten gains.

                When he found that it was getting easier and easier to be discovered, he took his wife Perenal and lived in seclusion.
                
                When I walk a lot at night, I’m afraid of encountering ghosts!
                
                As for immortality.
                
                That's only half right.
                
                You can live forever, but you can't live forever.
                
                The immortality potion prepared from the magic stone needs to be taken for a long time, and it can only maintain the life of the user.
                
                The body will still age slowly.
                
                Like Grandpa Nico and Grandma Perenal.
                
                At over 600 years old, their bodies were already so brittle that they would break if they were broken casually.
                
                Fortunately, the Du Wei they adopted has an extremely outstanding talent in magic.
                
                Du Wei successfully developed a magic potion that can repair the body to a certain extent last year.
                
                Finally, the physical functions of my grandparents returned to the level of those in their sixties or seventies.
                
                The price is.
                
                His grandparents saw his talent in alchemy and potions, and were determined to cultivate a great magician for Beauxbatons who could surpass Dumbledore!
                
                Try to outdo Dumbledore!
                
                What a grand wish!
                
                It can only be said that the Lemay couple are indeed the most outstanding alumni of Beauxbatons France!
                
                He always wants to restore the glory of Beauxbatons School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                
                But Du Wei doesn’t have such great ideals!
                
                time travel.
                
                Magical world.
                
                He was also adopted by Nicoléme, a powerful and wealthy man.
                
                I have been at the top from the beginning, where do you want me to work hard?
                
                As long as Du Wei thinks.
                
                He can win over all the outstanding graduates of Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang in the next eleven years.
                
                The future Minister of the Ministry of Magic, the future Director of the Auror Office, the Flower of France, and the future MVP of the Quidditch World Cup all work for me!
                
                effort?
                
                Grandpa and grandma, you have accumulated more than 600 years of experience. What’s the point of asking me to work hard?
                
                Trying to become the next Dark Lord?
                
                But Du Wei didn't dare to say this.
                
                Because his grandparents were really good to him.
                
                Just like a biological child.
                
                In order not to disappoint his grandparents, Du Wei could only work a little harder.
                
                When the grandson makes the elderly happy, he has become more and more skilled.
                
                For example, the complete set of kitchen utensils in the kitchen was made by him based on the principles of wizard chess.
                
                Just give the recipe.
                
                Eight major Chinese cuisines, American fresh seafood, and British dark cuisine can all be prepared automatically.
                
                You can even collect meal reviews to continuously improve the taste.
                
                A wonderful alchemical invention, just for eating.
                
                Du Wei's life is so boring.
                
                in the foreseeable future.
                
                He hoped this boredom would last forever.            </p>
